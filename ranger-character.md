## Backstory: The Reluctant Hero

For over a century, Theren worked the forges of Silverleaf Village, crafting tools and weapons with the patient skill passed down through generations of his family. His smith's tools weren't just instruments of trade - they were his connection to a proud lineage of artisans who had served their community for centuries. Life was predictable, honest work that let him provide for his people without the complications of politics or glory-seeking.

Everything changed the night the Wild Court came calling.

The fey weren't raiders or monsters - they were *recruiters*. The Archfey of the Autumn Court had grown fascinated with elven craftsmanship and demanded the village's finest smith serve in their realm. When the village elders gathered to "discuss terms," Theren realized with growing horror that they were actually *considering* the offer. The fey promised prosperity, magical knowledge, protection from other threats - all for the small price of their master craftsman.

The debate raged for hours. Some argued it was an honor. Others feared refusing would bring down terrible retribution. But no one asked Theren what he wanted.

When dawn broke, the elders had reached their decision: they would "respectfully recommend" that their smith accept this "generous opportunity." The vote wasn't even close.

That night, Theren took up his bow for the first time in decades and drove the fey court from his village - alone. Not because he wanted to be a hero, but because no one else would act. The grateful villagers called him their champion, but he knew the truth: when it mattered most, they had been ready to trade him away.

He still carries his smith's tools, not just to remember his craft, but to remember that when people's comfort is threatened, principles become negotiable. His trust, once freely given, now has to be earned through actions - not words, not promises, not good intentions.

**The Twist**: Theren isn't hunting fey out of hatred. He's hunting them because he understands them. The Wild Courts don't see mortals as evil - they see them as *useful*. And sometimes, so do the mortals themselves.

*"Everyone's loyal until the cost gets too high. Then you find out who you really are."*
