# D&D Character Planning Checklist

## Questions for Your DM/Group

- [ ] What's the campaign setting/theme? (high fantasy, gritty, political, dungeon crawl)
- [ ] Any house rules or restrictions on races/classes?
- [ ] How long will sessions be? (affects complexity comfort)

## Questions for Your Party
- [ ] What roles are already covered?
  - Tank (takes damage)
  - Healer (keeps party alive)
  - Damage dealer (kills enemies)
  - Face (social encounters)
  - Utility (problem solving, skills)
- [ ] What's the group dynamic like? (serious, comedic, mixed)
- [ ] Any characters I should/shouldn't overlap with?

## Character Concept Self-Reflection

### Personality Traits I Want
- [ ] Stoic and reserved
- [ ] Socially capable but gets drained
- [ ] Loner tendencies
- [ ] What motivates them? (adventure, knowledge, money, duty, revenge)
- [ ] What do they fear or dislike?
- [ ] What's their background before adventuring?

### Gameplay Preferences
- [ ] Do I want magic? (yes/no/a little)
- [ ] Do I want to be in melee combat or ranged?
- [ ] Do I prefer simple mechanics or complex ones?
- [ ] Do I want to be the party leader or follower?
- [ ] Am I okay with being the "face" sometimes?

## Class Options to Research

### Simple/Beginner Friendly
- [ ] **Fighter**: Straightforward combat, versatile, tough
- [ ] **Rogue**: Skills, stealth, reliable damage
- [ ] **Ranger**: Nature skills, some magic, independent

### Moderate Complexity
- [ ] **Warlock**: Limited but powerful magic, mysterious patron
- [ ] **Sorcerer**: Innate magic, flexible spell use
- [ ] **Cleric**: Healing/support, prepared spells

### More Complex (maybe save for later)
- [ ] **Wizard**: Lots of spells, tactical
- [ ] **Bard**: Jack-of-all-trades, social
- [ ] **Druid**: Shapeshifting, nature magic

## Race Considerations
- [ ] Human: Versatile, extra skills
- [ ] Half-Elf: Charismatic, fits "between worlds" theme
- [ ] Variant Human: Extra feat at level 1
- [ ] Tiefling: Outsider vibe, innate magic
- [ ] Other races that sound interesting?

## Character Backstory Elements
- [ ] Where are they from?
- [ ] What was their life before adventuring?
- [ ] Why did they leave that life?
- [ ] What do they hope to achieve?
- [ ] Any important relationships or enemies?
- [ ] How do they view magic/religion/authority?

## Mechanical Decisions to Make Later
- [ ] Ability scores (Strength, Dex, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma)
- [ ] Starting equipment
- [ ] Specific spells (if applicable)
- [ ] Skills to be proficient in
- [ ] Background (gives skills and personality hooks)
