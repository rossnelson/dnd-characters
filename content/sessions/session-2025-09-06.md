# Session Summary

## Combat Encounters

### Key Learnings
- **Perception Checks**: Rolled multiple poor perception checks - need to rely more on party members or find ways to boost perception
- **Weapon Effectiveness**: Short swords proving ineffective against most enemies
  - Consider switching to longbow as primary weapon (d8 damage vs d6)
  - Use Hunter's Mark spell when available (level 2) for extra damage
  - Dual-wielding shortswords only adds one extra d6 attack

### Goblin Encounter
- Successfully defeated and looted goblin
- **Loot Gained**:
  - Copper pieces gained
  - Silver pieces gained
  - Total wealth: 26 gp (25 gold, 15 silver, 37 copper)

## Tactical Notes

### Perception Issues
- Multiple failed perception checks impacting situational awareness
- **Future strategies**:
  - Stay near party members with higher perception
  - Use Passive Perception (10 + Wisdom modifier) when possible
  - Consider taking Alert feat at level 4 for +5 to initiative

### Combat Effectiveness
- Short swords (1d6 damage each) proving insufficient
- **Recommendations**:
  - Prioritize ranged combat with longbow (1d8 + Dex)
  - Save melee for emergencies or finishing blows
  - At level 2, consider Archery fighting style for +2 to attack rolls

## Character Status

### Current Resources
- **Hit Points**: [Current/Max]
- **Spell Slots**: N/A (Level 1 Ranger)
- **Ammunition**: Check arrow count

### Inventory Updates
- **Currency**: 
  - Gold: 25 gp
  - Silver: 15 sp  
  - Copper: 37 cp
  - **Total**: 26 gp, 5 sp, 7 cp (converted value)

### Equipment Considerations
- May need to invest in:
  - Better armor if available
  - More arrows for longbow focus
  - Healing potions with newfound wealth
  - Consider silvered weapons for specific enemies

## Party Dynamics
- [Note any party interactions or team combat observations]

## Next Session Prep
- [ ] Review ranger combat options
- [ ] Discuss combat tactics with party
- [ ] Check if town has better equipment available
- [ ] Practice with longbow over short swords
- [ ] Ask DM about perception check alternatives

## Location: Nightstone

### Areas Explored
1. **Church** - Investigated, details unknown
2. **Graveyard** - Encountered spectres
   - Wisely avoided direct combat (spectres require magical weapons)
   - Used dodge action to avoid attacks
   - Physical weapons (shortswords, arrows) likely ineffective against incorporeal undead
3. **Building 8** - Current location

### NPCs Encountered

#### Kella Darko
- **Appearance**: Blonde woman in white robes
- **Location**: Found in Building 8
- **Companion**: Flying snake carrying a piece of paper
- **Status**: Unknown intentions - HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS
- **Notes**: 
  - Name seems suspicious (Darko?)
  - Flying snake carrying paper = messenger snake!
  - She's communicating with someone outside Nightstone
  - Could be: sending intel, calling for backup, or reporting to handlers
  - Message could contain: town layout, guard positions, treasure locations
  - Flying snakes are Tiny beasts (AC 14, 5 HP, bite has poison)
  - This explains why she's alone - she has communication method
  - She might be a scout or spy for larger group
  - CRITICAL: Try to intercept/read that message if possible
  - UPDATE: Party attempting to communicate with the snake directly

## Combat: Spectres
- **Enemy Type**: Incorporeal undead
- **Tactics Used**: Dodge action (smart choice)
- **Lesson Learned**: Some enemies require magical weapons or spells
- **Party Response**: [How did other party members handle spectres?]

## DM Notes/Clues
- Nightstone has church and graveyard (religious significance?)
- Spectres present = unnatural death or necromancy
- Building numbering system suggests organized town
- Kella Darko's presence needs investigation

## Personal Notes
- Theren's suspicious nature validated - poor perception could have been deadly
- Need to rely on proven allies more (party members with better perception)
- Actions speak louder than dice rolls - positioning matters
