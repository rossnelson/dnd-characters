# Session Recap (Sept 6 - Jan 10)

## City Exploration

The party continued moving through the city, systematically clearing buildings of threats. More creatures were encountered and defeated, with additional gold recovered from the ruins.

**Barzer's Rampage**: True to form, Barzer set fire to everything in sight, leaving a trail of smoldering destruction in our wake.

## New Acquisitions

- **Horses and Tack**: The party acquired horses and riding equipment, greatly improving our mobility.

## The Keep

### Discovery
We made our way to the keep and discovered guards standing watch over a dead body - an ominous sign of recent trouble.

### Stealth Operations
The party successfully raided several rooms without alerting the guards, gathering intelligence and resources.

### Alliance with the Guards
Through careful diplomacy, we convinced the guards to join forces with us against Kella Darkhope's associates - a group of bandits operating in the area.

## Theren's Encounter with the Bandits

### The Confrontation
Theren was spotted by the bandits while scouting. Already knowing they were up to no good, he saw no need to waste time extracting information from them.

### Tactical Retreat
Making a calculated decision, Theren brazenly told the bandits to "go about their business" - a deliberate choice to postpone the confrontation until the party could engage together. He then reported back to the group to coordinate their next move.

**Key Takeaway**: The bandits are confirmed hostile, and Theren wisely chose to delay the fight rather than engage alone.

## Next Session

- Confront Kella Darkhope's bandit allies
- Coordinate attack with the keep guards
- Investigate the dead body and its connection to recent events
