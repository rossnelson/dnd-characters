# Situation Assessment

## What You Know
- Bandits are allied with Kella Darkhope
- They're positioned in the city across the moat from the keep
- The keep guards are willing to help fight them
- The bandits know you're aware of their presence (Theren was spotted)
- You have horses and tack for mobility
- The moat separates you from the bandits

## Party Assets
- **Theren (Ranger)**: Ranged combat, tracking, favored terrain advantage
- **Barzer**: Fire-based offense (devastating but risky in enclosed spaces)
- **Allied Guards**: Numbers advantage, know the keep layout
- **Horses**: Mobility for pursuit or rapid repositioning
- **The Moat**: Natural chokepoint and defensive barrier

# Choose Your Strategy

---

## Option A: The Moat Ambush
*"Make them come to us"*

### The Plan
Hold position at the keep. Use taunts, bluffs, or bait to lure the bandits into attacking across the moat. Turn the water crossing into a kill zone.

### Tactics
1. **Lure them out** using one of these methods:
   - **The Taunt**: Send Theren to challenge their courage
   - **The Bluff**: Claim reinforcements are coming - attack now or lose your chance
   - **The Prize**: Let them see valuables being moved into the keep
2. **Position for ambush**:
   - Theren takes elevated position with clear sightlines to the moat
   - Barzer and guards wait inside, ready to strike
3. **Execute the ambush**:
   - Theren harasses as they approach
   - When bandits commit to crossing, they're slowed and exposed in the water
   - Barzer and guards hit them mid-crossing
   - Horses ready to pursue any who flee

### Battle Positioning
```
        [KEEP]
          |
    [GUARDS + BARZER ready]
          |
    === MOAT === (kill zone)
          |
    [THEREN - elevated, ranged]
          |
      [BANDITS approach]
```

### Pros
- Maximum tactical advantage - enemies are slowed and exposed in water
- Guards stay with you as reinforcements
- Barzer's fire is safer near water
- Horses positioned for pursuit if bandits flee
- You choose when and where to fight

### Cons
- Bandits might not take the bait
- Gives them time to fortify, escape, or call for reinforcements
- Requires patience

### Best If
You want to minimize risk and maximize your defensive advantages.

## Option B: The City Assault
*"Take the fight to them"*

### The Plan
Cross the moat and assault the bandits in the city. Use stealth to close the distance, then strike hard and fast before they can organize a defense.

### Tactics
1. **Reconnaissance**: Theren scouts bandit positions and numbers
2. **Stealthy approach**: Cross the moat quietly, possibly at night or using distractions
3. **Rapid assault**: Hit their position fast, don't let them regroup
4. **Secure the area**: Clear building by building if needed

### Pros
- Element of surprise - they expect you to stay at the keep
- Ends the threat quickly and decisively
- Prevents bandits from escaping or getting reinforcements
- You control the timing

### Cons
- Surrender the moat's defensive advantage
- City streets neutralize your horse mobility
- Barzer's fire is dangerous in enclosed buildings - collateral damage risk
- Guards may be reluctant to leave the keep
- Fighting in unfamiliar terrain favors the defenders

### Best If
You have good intel on bandit positions and want to end this fast.

## Option C: The Ultimatum
*"Surrender or die"*

### The Plan
March the full force (party + guards) to the moat's edge in full view. Make a show of overwhelming strength. Demand the bandits surrender Kella Darkhope and leave - or face destruction.

### Tactics
1. **Display strength**: Line up party and guards at the moat, weapons visible
2. **Deliver terms**:
   - Hand over Kella Darkhope
   - Remaining bandits may leave peacefully
   - Refusal means no quarter
3. **Set a deadline**: Give them one hour to decide
4. **Be ready**: If they refuse, execute Option A (Moat Ambush)

### Pros
- Might end without bloodshed
- Demonstrates strength and control
- Could turn some bandits against Kella to save themselves
- Prisoners mean information about Kella's plans
- Moral high ground - you offered mercy

### Cons
- Gives bandits time to prepare defenses or plan escape
- They might call your bluff
- Splits the party's attention between negotiation and combat readiness
- Kella may use the time to slip away

### Best If
You want information, prefer diplomacy, or want to minimize casualties on both sides.

# Recommendation

**Option A (Moat Ambush)** gives you the strongest tactical position. You have every advantage at the keep - defensive terrain, allied forces, mobility for pursuit. Crossing the moat surrenders all of that.

However, **Option C (Ultimatum)** lets you try diplomacy first while keeping Option A as your fallback. Show strength, offer terms, and if they refuse, you're already positioned for the ambush.

---

# Questions to Discuss as a Party

1. How patient are we? (Ambush requires waiting)
2. Do we want prisoners for information?
3. How much do we trust Barzer not to burn down the city?
4. Will the guards follow us across the moat?
5. Is Kella Darkhope the priority, or eliminating all the bandits?

# Ranger Tips for Theren

- **Elevated position**: Find high ground with cover overlooking the moat
- **Hunter's Mark**: Save it for the leader or any spellcasters
- **Called shots**: Target enemies mid-moat when they can't dodge effectively
- **Watch for runners**: Your mobility lets you pursue fleeing enemies

*The best strategy is one your whole party commits to. Discuss, decide, execute.*
