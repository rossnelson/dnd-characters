## What You Know
- Bandits were allied with Kella Darkhope (now dead)
- They're positioned in the city across the moat from the keep
- The keep guards are willing to help fight them
- The bandits know you're aware of their presence (Theren was spotted)
- You have horses and tack for mobility
- The moat separates you from the bandits

## Party Assets

### Party Capabilities
- **Kaltor (Paladin)**: Frontline tank, Divine Smite burst damage, Bless
- **Theren (Ranger)**: Ranged DPS, Hunter's Mark, Cure Wounds
- **Barzer (War Wizard)**: Fire Bolt, Magic Missile, Fog Cloud, Shield reaction
- **Nysera (Forest Druid)**: Flaming Sphere, Moonbeam for area control
- **Elaris (Lore Bard)**: Healing Word, Hideous Laughter, high Charisma for negotiation
- **Selena (Life Cleric)**: Primary healer, Healing Word, Sanctuary, Bless

### Other Resources
- **Allied Guards**: Numbers advantage, know the keep layout
- **Horses**: Mobility for pursuit or rapid repositioning

## Questions to Discuss

1. How patient are we? (Ambush requires waiting)
2. Do we want prisoners for information about Kella's plans?
3. Should Elaris attempt negotiation first given her high Charisma?
4. Who leads the assault - Kaltor is our only real frontliner?
5. Do we need to eliminate all the bandits, or just scatter them?

## If We Take Prisoners

Kella had a flying snake messenger - she was communicating with someone. Priority intel:

1. **Who was Kella working for?** She wasn't acting alone.
2. **What was the message?** What intel was she sending out?
3. **Are reinforcements coming?** Is someone expecting to hear back?
4. **Why Nightstone?** What made this ruined town worth infiltrating?
5. **How many more of them are there?** Just these bandits, or part of something bigger?

Elaris should lead interrogation (CHA +4). Kaltor's Paladin presence might intimidate, or Theren's quiet intensity could unnerve them.
