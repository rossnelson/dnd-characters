## What You Know
- Bandits were allied with Kella Darkhope (now dead)
- They're positioned in the city across the moat from the keep
- The keep guards are willing to help fight them
- The bandits know you're aware of their presence (Theren was spotted)
- You have horses and tack for mobility
- The moat separates you from the bandits

## Party Assets
- **Theren (Ranger)**: Ranged combat, tracking, favored terrain advantage
- **Barzer**: Fire-based offense (devastating but risky in enclosed spaces)
- **Allied Guards**: Numbers advantage, know the keep layout
- **Horses**: Mobility for pursuit or rapid repositioning
- **The Moat**: Natural chokepoint and defensive barrier

## Questions to Discuss

1. How patient are we? (Ambush requires waiting)
2. Do we want prisoners for information about Kella's plans?
3. How much do we trust Barzer not to burn down the city?
4. Will the guards follow us across the moat?
5. Do we need to eliminate all the bandits, or just scatter them?
