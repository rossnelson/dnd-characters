## Questions to Discuss

1. How patient are we? (Ambush requires waiting)
2. Do we want prisoners for information about Kella's plans?
3. Should Elaris attempt negotiation first given her high Charisma?
4. Who leads the assault - Kaltor is our only real frontliner?
5. Do we need to eliminate all the bandits, or just scatter them?
