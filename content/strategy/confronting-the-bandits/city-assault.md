Cross the moat and assault the bandits in the city. Use stealth to close the distance, then strike hard and fast before they can organize a defense.

## Tactics

1. **Reconnaissance**: Theren scouts bandit positions and numbers
2. **Stealthy approach**: Cross the moat quietly, possibly at night or using distractions
3. **Rapid assault**: Hit their position fast, don't let them regroup
4. **Secure the area**: Clear building by building if needed

## Pros
- Element of surprise - they expect you to stay at the keep
- Ends the threat quickly and decisively
- Prevents bandits from escaping or getting reinforcements
- You control the timing

## Cons
- Surrender the moat's defensive advantage
- City streets neutralize your horse mobility
- Barzer's fire is dangerous in enclosed buildings - collateral damage risk
- Guards may be reluctant to leave the keep
- Fighting in unfamiliar terrain favors the defenders

## Best If
You have good intel on bandit positions and want to end this fast.
