March the full force (party + guards) to the moat's edge in full view. Make a show of overwhelming strength. Demand the bandits surrender - Kella is dead, there's no reason to keep fighting.

## Tactics

1. **Display strength**: Line up party and guards at the moat, weapons visible
2. **Deliver terms**:
   - Kella is dead - whatever deal they had is over
   - Surrender and leave peacefully
   - Refusal means no quarter
3. **Set a deadline**: Give them one hour to decide
4. **Be ready**: If they refuse, execute the Moat Ambush

## Pros
- Might end without bloodshed
- Demonstrates strength and control
- Bandits may question why they're still fighting
- Prisoners mean information about what Kella was planning
- Moral high ground - you offered mercy

## Cons
- Gives bandits time to prepare defenses or plan escape
- They might call your bluff
- Splits the party's attention between negotiation and combat readiness
- Unknown how loyal the bandits were to Kella

## Best If
You want information, prefer diplomacy, or want to minimize casualties on both sides.
