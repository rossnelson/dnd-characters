Hold position at the keep. Use taunts, bluffs, or bait to lure the bandits into attacking across the moat. Turn the water crossing into a kill zone.

## Tactics

1. **Lure them out** using one of these methods:
   - **The Taunt**: Send Theren to challenge their courage
   - **The Bluff**: Claim reinforcements are coming - attack now or lose your chance
   - **The Prize**: Let them see valuables being moved into the keep
2. **Position for ambush**:
   - Theren takes elevated position with clear sightlines to the moat
   - Barzer and guards wait inside, ready to strike
3. **Execute the ambush**:
   - Theren harasses as they approach
   - When bandits commit to crossing, they're slowed and exposed in the water
   - Barzer and guards hit them mid-crossing
   - Horses ready to pursue any who flee

## Battle Positioning
```
        [KEEP]
          |
    [GUARDS + BARZER ready]
          |
    === MOAT === (kill zone)
          |
    [THEREN - elevated, ranged]
          |
      [BANDITS approach]
```

## Pros
- Maximum tactical advantage - enemies are slowed and exposed in water
- Guards stay with you as reinforcements
- Barzer's fire is safer near water
- Horses positioned for pursuit if bandits flee
- You choose when and where to fight

## Cons
- Bandits might not take the bait
- Gives them time to fortify, escape, or call for reinforcements
- Requires patience

## Best If
You want to minimize risk and maximize your defensive advantages.

## Ranger Tips for Theren

- **Elevated position**: Find high ground with cover overlooking the moat
- **Hunter's Mark**: Save it for the leader or any spellcasters
- **Called shots**: Target enemies mid-moat when they can't dodge effectively
- **Watch for runners**: Your mobility lets you pursue fleeing enemies
