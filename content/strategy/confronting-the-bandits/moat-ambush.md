Hold position at the keep. Use taunts, bluffs, or bait to lure the bandits into attacking across the moat. Turn the water crossing into a kill zone.

## Tactics

1. **Lure them out** using one of these methods:
   - **The Taunt**: Send Theren to challenge their courage
   - **The Bluff**: Claim reinforcements are coming - attack now or lose your chance
   - **The Prize**: Let them see valuables being moved into the keep
2. **Position for ambush**:
   - Kaltor holds the moat crossing with guards as the frontline
   - Theren takes elevated position with clear sightlines
   - Barzer and Nysera position for AoE coverage of the crossing
   - Selena and Elaris stay back for healing and support
3. **Execute the ambush**:
   - Theren harasses with Hunter's Mark as they approach
   - Nysera drops Flaming Sphere or Moonbeam on the crossing
   - When bandits commit to crossing, Kaltor and guards engage
   - Barzer provides Fire Bolt support from safe distance
   - Selena casts Bless on frontliners, Elaris has Healing Word ready
   - Horses ready to pursue any who flee

## Battle Positioning
```
           [KEEP]
              |
    [SELENA + ELARIS - healing/support]
              |
    [BARZER + NYSERA - ranged/AoE]
              |
    [KALTOR + GUARDS - frontline]
              |
    ======= MOAT ======= (kill zone)
              |
    [THEREN - elevated, ranged]
              |
         [BANDITS approach]
```

## Pros
- Maximum tactical advantage - enemies are slowed and exposed in water
- Guards stay with you as reinforcements
- Barzer's fire is safer near water
- Horses positioned for pursuit if bandits flee
- You choose when and where to fight

## Cons
- Bandits might not take the bait
- Gives them time to fortify, escape, or call for reinforcements
- Requires patience

## Best If
You want to minimize risk and maximize your defensive advantages.

## Ranger Tips for Theren

- **Elevated position**: Find high ground with cover overlooking the moat
- **Hunter's Mark**: Save it for the leader or any spellcasters
- **Called shots**: Target enemies mid-moat when they can't dodge effectively
- **Watch for runners**: Your mobility lets you pursue fleeing enemies
